    "We study continuous random variables and their probability density functions. PDFs replace PMFs from the discrete case.

We don't prove it mathematically, but the formula seems intuitively coherent. We can see from the Normal PDF formula that if $\\sigma$ increases, the graph becomes wider.

This volume will be equal to $f_X(a)\\cdot\\delta$. See Ex 3.10 or Lec 9.8 to understand marginal PDF with an example."
