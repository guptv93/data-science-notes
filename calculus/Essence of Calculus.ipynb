    "### Lecture 1 (Overview)\n",
    "Shows how calculating areas under the graph of a function can be useful. To show this, it calculates the area of a circle by converting it into area under a linear graph. Luckily here the area under the graph was a triangle. How do we calculate areas under more complicated graphs? It is hard to look at this problem directly. But we notice that $\\frac{dA}{dx} = f(x)$. This property is gonna help us in our quest.  \n",

    "### Lecture 2 (Rate of Change at an Instant?)\n",
    "What do you mean by instantaneous rate of change? Change is over an interval. So how can we measure change at one particular instant? When the odometer measures the instantaneous rate of change, it takes an actual very small change in distance and divides it by a very small change in time. Mathematically, to calculate instantaneous rate of change, we calculate $\\frac{\\Delta f(x)}{\\Delta x}$ at some particular $x=x_0$, and make ${\\Delta x}$ approach 0. Finally, we see how to calculate this rate of change for an algebraic function $x^3$ by solving $\\frac{(x+dx)^3 - x^3}{dx}$.  \n",

    "### Lecture 3 (Derivatives through Geometry)\n",
    "In the last lecture we saw how to calculate $\\frac{dx^3}{dx}$ using algebra. In this lecture we calculate the same quantity using intuitive geometry. We represent $x^2$ as the area of a square with side $x$ and $x^3$ as volume of a cube with side $x$. Then we increase $x$ by a small nudge and see how much the area or volume changes. Finally we check (roughly through visualization) if the formula equals the slope of the tangent. The lecture also goes over why $\\frac{dx^n}{x} = nx^{n-1}$ and explains intuitively why the formula also works for $f(x) = 1/x$ and $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. It also discusses intuitively deriving $\\frac{d(sinx)}{dx}$.  \n",

    "### Lecture 4 (Chain Rule, Product Rule)\n",
    "**Sum Rule** : $\\frac{d(f(x) + g(x))}{dx}=\\frac{d(f(x))}{dx} + \\frac{d(g(x))}{dx}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Rule** : $\\frac{d(uv)}{dx} = u\\frac{dv}{dx} + v\\frac{du}{dx}$  \n",
    "*The derivation for this formula is very elegant, where $u$ and $v$ are considered as the sides of a rectangle.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition Rule** : $\\frac{dg(h(x))}{dx} = \\frac{dg(h(x))}{dh(x)}\\frac{dh(x)}{dx}$ **OR** $\\frac{dg(h(x))}{dx} = \\left[\\frac{dg(u)}{du}\\right]_{u=h(x)}\\frac{dh(x)}{dx}$  \n",
    "*We measure how much $g$ changes with unit change to its input, and then multiply that quantity with the actual change in input to $g$, $d(h(x))$ on unit change in input. The cancellation of $d(h(x))$ is not a notational trick (unlike what Wilson Sir explained). It is actually possible to cancel it out, because it represents the same quantity in numerator and denominator.*  \n",

    "### Lecture 5 (Exponential Functions and $e$)\n",
    "It goes over how to find the derivate of an exponential. In the process it introduces and defines $e$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of exponential functions tells us a very important fact: The rate of growth of the function is directly proportionate to the current value of the function. There are many real world scenarios where this holds. Like the population of a city, isotopic half life etc. Thus exponential functions are very common in the nature.  \n",

    "### Lecture 6 (Implicit Differentiation)\n",
    "*Avoid the video.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit differentiation is nothing more than a special case of the well-known chain rule for derivatives. The majority of differentiation problems involve functions $y$ written explicitly as functions of $x$. For example, if $y = 3x^2 + sin(4x)$, then $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 4sin(4x)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some functions $y$ are written implicitly as functions of $x$. A familiar example of this is the equation\n",
    "$$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Equation of the form above can be dealt in two ways. One is to make them into explicit function definitions. $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ can be written in explicit functional form as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y = +\\sqrt{25-x^2}\\\\\n",
    "y = -\\sqrt{25-x^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the positive square root represents the top semi-circle and the negative square root represents the bottom semi-circle. Now finding derivative is the same as finding $\\frac{df(x)}{dx}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not every equation involving $x$ and $y$ can be solved explicitly for $y$ ($y \\neq f(x)$). In that case, we should consider $x$ and $y$ as two separate variables and the equation should be seen to have the form $f(x,y) = c$. All the points where $f(x,y)$ is equal to $c$ are on the graph and those for which $f(x,y) <> c$ are not on the curve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question then would be what does $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ stand for if $x$ and $y$ are different variables? Remember that on the curve when we change $x$ by $dx$, $y$ changes by $dy$ such that value of $f(x,y)$ remains the same. Thus we can equate $\\frac{df(x,y)}{dx}$ to zero, and then find a relation between $dy$ and $dx$. This $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ will be such that $(x+dx,y+dy)$ is on the curve. Thus this $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ gives the slope of tangent to $f(x,y) = c$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if we are given an equation $f(x,y) = c$, we can take derivates on both sides of the equation to find the slope of the tangent.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "&x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\\\\n",
    "\\implies& 2x + 2y\\,\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\implies& \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{-x}{y} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This second method illustrates the process of implicit differentiation. It is important to note that the derivative expression for explicit differentiation involves $x$ only, while the derivative expression for implicit differentiation may involve both $x$ AND $y$ .  \n",

    "### Lecture 7 (Limits, L'Hopital's rule)  \n",
    "Formal definition of derivative:\n",
    "$$\\frac{df(x)}{dx} = \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "Observe that $df(x)$ does actually mean a small nudge to $f(x)$ and $dx$ does mean a small nudge to x.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The video also goes over the formal $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-definition of limits and L'Hopital's rule. Go through the video to catch the intuition behind the rule.  \n",

    "### Lecture 8 (Integration and Anti-derivative)\n",
    "This lecture basically explains why finding the area under a graph (integration of the graph) is the same as finding the anti-derivative of the graph. It also explains the additive constant that comes up while talking anti-derivative and how to find the constant. Basically what is says is that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "&\\frac{dg(x)}{dx} = f(x)\\\\\n",
    "\\implies &\\int^T_af(x)dx =function(T) = g(T) + C\\\\\n",
    "\\textrm{But when T = a,}&\\int^a_af(x)dx = 0 = g(a) + C\\\\\n",
    "\\implies & \\int^T_af(x)dx = g(T) - g(a)\\\\\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "This theorem that \"integration = anti-derivative\" is called Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lecture 9 (Area and Slope)\n",
    "First the lecture tells us how to find the average of a function over some interval. Suppose in the interval from $a$ to $b$, we take samples at $\\Delta x$ distance. Then the average would be:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\sum{samples}}{(b-a)/\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\Delta x\\sum{samples}}{b-a} = \\frac{\\int^b_a{f(x)dx}}{b-a} (as \\Delta x \\to 0)\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This fact that we proved above offers a different way of looking into why derivates and integrals are related of one another. Finding the average value of $f(x)$ comes down to calculating the change in the anti-derivative of $f(x)$ (let us call it $g(x)$) divided by the length of the input range. $\\frac{dg(x)}{dx} = f(x)$. Thus, by definition, the value of $f(x)$ at any $x$ is the slope of the tangent to $g(x)$ at that $x$. Thus average value of $f(x)$ over $a$ to $b$ denotes the average tangential slope of $g(x)$ over that interval. It makes sense that the average tangential slope of $g(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ would be slope of the line joining $(a,g(a))$ and $(b,g(b))$. Therefore \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\int^b_a{f(x)dx}}{b-a} = \\frac{g(b) - g(a)}{b-a}\n",

    "### Lecture 10 (Higher Order Derivatives)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{d(\\frac{df}{dx})}{dx}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lecture 11 (Taylor Series)  \n",
    "Taylor Series is all about expressing various functions of $x$ in the form of a sum of polynomial terms of $x$, such that they have almost the same values in the vicinity of some $x=a$. If we want a polynomial approximation for $f(x)$ at $x=0$, we use the following approximation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To find all the $c$'s in the above equation, we keep equating the various order derivatives of $f(x)_{x=0}$ to the derivatives of the polynomial function at $x=0$. To get the polynomial approximation at $x=a$, we use the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + c_3(x-a)^3 + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Taylor Series uses derivative information at some point to approximation information near that point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lecture 12 (Beyond Slopes)\n",
    "Generally we think of derivative of a $\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ function as the slope of the graph. In this lecture we are shown how to think of derivatives as the amount of stretching of squishing that an interval goes through when transformed by a function.\n"
